# 📘 Student Grading System (Python)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This is a simple **Python-based Student Grading System** that helps calculate and display grades for multiple students.  
It uses **loops**, **functions**, and **dictionaries**, making it a great beginner project to understand Python basics.

---

## 🧩 Features
✅ Add as many students as you want  
✅ Enter each student’s marks  
✅ Automatically calculate letter grades (A+, A, B, C, D, F)  
✅ Display all results clearly  
✅ Simple and clean user interface in the console

## 💻 Technologies Used
- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🧮 **Dictionaries** for storing data  
- 🔁 **Loops** for repeated input  
- ⚙️ **Functions** for reusable code  

---

## 📜 How It Works
1. The program asks you to **enter each student’s name and marks**.  
2. If you type **‘exit’**, the program stops taking input.  
3. It then **calculates grades** using a separate function.  
4. Finally, it **displays all student names, marks, and grades** neatly.

## 🧾 Example Output
```
Enter student name (or type 'exit' to stop): Ali
Enter marks for Ali: 89

Enter student name (or type 'exit' to stop): Sara
Enter marks for Sara: 94

Enter student name (or type 'exit' to stop): Ahmed
Enter marks for Ahmed: 66

Enter student name (or type 'exit' to stop): exit

--- Student Grades ---
Ali scored 89 and got grade: A
Sara scored 94 and got grade: A+
Ahmed scored 66 and got grade: C

Program finished. Thank you!
```

## 🧮 Grade Criteria
| Marks Range | Grade |
|--------------|--------|
| 90 - 100 | A+ |
| 80 - 89 | A |
| 70 - 79 | B |
| 60 - 69 | C |
| 50 - 59 | D |
| Below 50 | F |

1. Open the file `Student_Grading_System.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**.  
2. Run all the cells.  
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter student names and marks.
